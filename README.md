# Fluid65
Particle based fluid simulator written in C++ with raylib, raylib-cpp, and opencv. This simulation is based on [this paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf) I found online. A demonstration render is on my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EthEYIIo8
